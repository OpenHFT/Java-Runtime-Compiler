Java-Runtime-Compiler
=====================
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.openhft/compiler/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.openhft/compiler)

This takes a String, compiles it and loads it to returning you a class from what you built.  
By default it uses the current ClassLoader. It supports nested classes, but otherwise build one class at a time.

## On maven central

You can include in your project with

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.openhft</groupId>
    <artifactId>compiler</artifactId>
    <version><!-- The latest version (see above) --></version>
</dependency>
```

## Simple example

You need a Cached Compiler and access to your JDK's tools.jar.

```java
// dynamically you can call
String className = "mypackage.MyClass";
String javaCode = "package mypackage;\n" +
                 "public class MyClass implements Runnable {\n" +
                 "    public void run() {\n" +
                 "        System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\n" +
                 "    }\n" +
                 "}\n";
Class aClass = CompilerUtils.CACHED_COMPILER.loadFromJava(className, javaCode);
Runnable runner = (Runnable) aClass.newInstance();
runner.run();
````
     
I suggest making you class implement a KnownInterface of your choice as this will allow you to call/manipulate instances of you generated class.

Another more hacky way is to use this to override a class, provided it hasn't been loaded already.  
This means you can redefine an existing class and provided the methods and fields used match,
you have compiler redefine a class and code already compiled to use the class will still work.

## Using the CachedCompiler.

In this example, you can configure the compiler to write the files to a specific directory when you are in debug mode.
       
```java
private static final CachedCompiler JCC = CompilerUtils.DEBUGGING ?
                                                   new CachedCompiler(new File(parent, "src/test/java"), new File(parent, "target/compiled")) :
                                                   CompilerUtils.CACHED_COMPILER;
```
     
By selecting the src directory to match where your IDE looks for those files, it will allow your debugger to set into code you have generated at runtime.

Note: you may need to delete these files if you want to regenerate them.
